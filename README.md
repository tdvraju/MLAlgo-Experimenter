# MLAlgo-Experimenter
* Running instance of the App can be found [here](https://share.streamlit.io/tdvraju/mlalgo-experimenter/app.py)
* This web application is basically to get a better feel for how various hyperparameters in models like Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, etc. affect the performance of the model. 
* In this app, a dataset from UCI has been taken and users can build their own model by choosing the classification algorithm and a set of hyperparameters. The performance of this model is given as the output using various performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and plots like ROC Curve, Precision-Recall Curve and Confusion Matrix.
* Built using streamlit, scikit learn in python
